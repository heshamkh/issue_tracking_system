# issue_tracking_system

This module basically creates a new content type with his fields on install "hook_install".
Also, this module provides a custom block getting the latest 3 issues assigned to the current user.

NOTE: We can also create this content type with some yml files with his fields.
I didn't create the Title field and the Reporter "author" since Drupal automatically created it.
